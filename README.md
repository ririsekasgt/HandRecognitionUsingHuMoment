# HandRecognitionUsingHuMoment
This program is used to detect hand gesture using Hu Moment Invariant Method and Euclidean Distance Classifier, which the final result is open an application on computer. 

this code is in Python languange using OpenCV

NOTE:<br>
1. If you want to make data train files by yourself, go to <b>datastore.py</b><br>
2. process your data train to get the extraction value of Hu Moment on *.npy files using <b>new_identify_eu.py</b><br>
3. run the <b>new_tes_euclidean.py</b> to start the main program.

But,<br>
If you want to use mine, <b>download all files except datastore.py</b>
